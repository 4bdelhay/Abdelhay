I have up to 2 yrs of malware development and initially it was very hard for me to start since a lot of resources were paywalled and there wasnt a direct route for you to develop malware. 
</center>
<br />
and today I'm giving all you need to start your journey as an exploits developper/reverse engineer

<center><p><li class="green-text"> Let's get started!</li></p></center>
<center><h3>First things First:</h3>
</center>
<h4>1/ LEARN C:</h4>this pretty much rosseta stone of computer programming languages from javascript to perl are built on top of C.

<center><h3>Reverse Engineering:
</h3>
</center>

-> <a href="https://github.com/hoppersroppers/nightmare">The Nightmare</a>
<br>
<br>
The Nightmare course is our main binary exploitation track, but the first 4 chapters are about learning the tools and RE. Work throught the first 4 sections until you get to the overflows section, then come on back to RE.
<br>
<br>
work back through h0mbre C using GDB and Ghidra for every assignment. This takes a while, but is a really good way to get familar with how to do Linux reverse engineering and become comfortable with disassembly

<center><h3>Malware RE:
</h3></center>
once you have become apt in reverse engineering you can start reverse engineering malware
